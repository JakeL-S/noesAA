{Skull}Ouro{Skull}

Above Ground
- Sweep (frontal cone cleave - high dmg knock back)
- Sand Blast (high AOE dmg) immobilizes

Underground
- Adds appear when he dives underground (and maybe when he resurfaces!)
- Quake (aoe dmg) - run away from the moving rock piles

At 20% enrages (Will use both above ground and underground abilities and summon adds)

Tactic:
- Tank him away from raid 
- Off tanks stay melee when he uses Sweep
- Melee out when he uses Sweep
- Ranged stays max range
- Healers stay further back (except those healing tanks and melee)
- T2 will be target of Sand Blast T2 stay away from ppl (need to be second on threat) 
- When underground move out of Quake 
- Gather at {Square} when resurface AOE adds
- At 20% nuke down (use CDs) be careful of all abilities
