{Skull}Heigan the Unclean{Skull}

Abilities:
- AOE MANA BURN: Drains large ammount of mana and deals shadow dmg equal to mana drained.
- ERUPTION: Errupts the floor in a predictable pattern causing 3500-4500 unresistable nature dmg.
- DECREPIT FEVER: Max health reduced by 50% and does 500 dmg every 3 sec. Curable?
- TELEPORT: Periodically teleports 3 players to the Eye Stalk tunne.

Fight cycle (135 sec):
- Phase 1: Heigan is in the field and eruption moves slowly for 90 sec.
- Phase 2:
    Heigan teleports to the platform which will be affected by heavy AoE.
    Eruptions will move more quickly but Heigan will not use AOE MANA BURN, DECREPIT FEVER or TELEPORT.
    This will last for 45 sec before returning to phase 1. Rinse and repeat.

Tactics:
- Ranged and healers stack on the platform during phase 1.
- Everyone needs to do the Heigan dance during phase 2!
