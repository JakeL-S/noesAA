{Skull}The Prophet Skeram{Skull}

Abilities:
- Arcane Explosion (1 sec cast time)
- Earth Shock (high Nature dmg spam) only casted if boss agro is on ranged player
- True Fulfillment (Mind control that makes a player big + heavy hitting)
- at 75%, 50% and 25%, the boss creates 2 low health versions of himself (same abilities)

Tactic:
**Ranged and Healers use a GNPP before fight**
- Tanks and Melee on middle platform with Skeram
- Ranged and Healers on the side platforms or up top
- Locks use Curse of Tongues to slow Arcane Explosions
- Interupt all Arcane Explosions
- Keep tank threat high to avoid Earth Shocks - if Earth Shocked move to melee range til you lose aggro
- Polymorph or Fear players who get mind controlled

PHASE CHANGE
- Before 75%, 50% and 25%, rogues and tanks should reposition to side platforms
- 2 tanks per platform (cos risk of MC) - OTs take low hp boss copies (to avoid Earth Shocks)
