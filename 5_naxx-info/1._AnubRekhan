{Skull}Anub'Rekhan{Skull}

Adds:
- Crypt Guard: elite spiders spawning continously
- Corpse scarabs: non-elite scarabs spawning when someone dies including enemy.

Abilities:
- Impale: Casts a long line of spikes towards a random player within 35 yards, 4000dmg on cloth. Everyone hit is thrown in the air and takes about 1000dmg.
- Corpse scarabs: Everytime a player or Crypt Guard dies, it will spawn 10 corpse scarabs.
- Locust Swarm: 30 yard AOE that affects everyone, silenceing and doing massive dmg. Anub'Rekhan has 40% movement speed during locust swarm. Used every 70-120sec.

Tactics:
- Put tank on Anub and the crypt guards and dps down the crypt guards first.
- Remember to kill all scarabs that spawns.
- Spread out to avoid impaleing the whole raid.
- Locust Swarm:
    Move to the center and kill the Crypt Guards that spawns.
    MT kites Anub in a half circle back to the entrance.
